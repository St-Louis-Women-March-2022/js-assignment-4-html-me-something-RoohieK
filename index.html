                  Chole bhature, also known as ‘channa bhatura’ is a North-Indian must-have. A combination of two dishes—chole, which is a spicy chickpea curry, and bhature, a type of fried bread made with maida—it makes for a meal that’s just right for Sunday afternoons, and should ideally be followed by a post-lunch snooze.
